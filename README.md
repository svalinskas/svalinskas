## âœ¨ Projects coming soon! âœ¨

### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Sarunas from Vilnius, Lithuania. My background is in Medicine, but now I'm starting as a data analyst thanks to a great course by Turing College <img src="/tc_icon.jpeg" width="25" height="25">. I'm driven to learn as much as I can and use my skills for healthcare data projects.
